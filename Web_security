Web Mechanics :--
    * 2 computers can be connected by linking them with 'Ethernet' cable for wifi or
     bluetooth. 
    * Such a network is not limited to two computers. You can connect as many pcs as
    you wish . It gets complicated.
    * So we use a Router. A Router is a pc that sends a pc's message to the right 
    destination pc.
    * A network of networks consists of routers connected to a bunch of routers...
    * These routers and long distance networks are maintained by telephone infra-
    -structure.We need 'Modems' to connect routers to telephone lines and convert 
    data into information manageable by telephone infrastructure.
    * The networks managed by these routers are in-turn managed by ISP companies.
    * pc-->router-->ISP-->same/diff ISP-->router-->diff pc
    * Each pc linked to a network has a unique IP Address [ex: 192.0.2.172].
    * Domain Name : -- Alias of an IP Address (bcoz we are lazy to remember numbers)
    * Internet :-- Is the network Infrastructure .
    * Web [email, IRC...] :-- A service built on top of internet.
    * Intranet :-- These are Private Networks that are Restricted to members of a 
      particular organisation. They are commonly used to provide a portal for 
      members to securely access shared resources, collaborate and communicate.
    * Extranet :-- Like intranet, these are private networks too. But these are used
      to connect securely with other organizations. They are used to securely share
      info between clients/shareholder and stakeholders who work closely with a 
      business.

Web Security:--
    Security : 
            It's the act of keeping private data and systems protected against 
    unauthorized access. This includes both company data and user and partner data.

    Privacy  : 
            It refers to the act of giving users control over how their data is
    collected and stored and used, while also ensuring that it is not used irrespon-
    -sibly. For example, you should let your users know what data you are collecting
    from them, the parties with whom it will be shared, and how it will be used. 
    Users must be given the chance to consent to your privacy policy, have access to
    their data you store, and delete it they choose to.

    Security features provided by browsers :
        Same Origin Policy :--
            It's a fundamental security mechanism of the web that restricts how a 
        document or script is loaded from one origin can interact with a resource 
        from another origin.

React JS :--
    * A Frontend Open Source Framework which is used to develop user interfaces specifically for applications with single page.
    * Different content is rendered on that single page page dynamically according to User/Clients Requests.

            /favicon.ico
            /index.html -------> Acts as the entry point of the web app. Has the foundational HTML structure where all content is

        /src/ -----------------> Means Source Files Folder
            /App.css ----------> Css for App.js Component
            /App.js -----------> A basic react component
            /AppTest.js
            /index.css --------> Css for index.js component
            /index.js ---------> Contains js code to render components like 'App.js' into index.html

React Components :--
    * React components are re-usable,independent pieces of code that define specific parts of a UI.
    * Each Component has it own JS Logic to render content on different parts of the UI.
    * Each Component has Phases in it lifecycle from creation to removal from DOM.
    * Two Types of Components :--
        Functional Componenets :--
            Example :-- 
                src/components/Comp1.js :--
                    >> export default function Comp1() {
                    >>      return (
                    >>          <div>
                    >>              <h1>This is Comp1</h1>
                    >>          </div>
                    >>              )
                    >>                                 }

            Function Component Life Cycle :--
                * Mounting :-- In mounting phase, a func comp is created and added to DOM. In this phase, you intialize state and 
                render the comp for the first time.
                               Usually useState can be used to intialize state and useEffect with empty dependency array to run some
                code for the first time when the DOM renders.
                * Updating :-- In this phase, a func comp is re-rendered on to the DOM when there's a change in props or state vars.
                               You can use useState to update state vars and useEffect with non-empty dependency array to re-render the
                component when prop/state vars inside the dependency array is updated.
                * Un-Mounting :-- In this pase, the comp in being removes from the DOM. A cleanup func inside useEffect hooks can do it.
                                  By returning a function with cleanup code from 'useEffect' hook you can perform un-mounting.

        Class Components :--
            Example :--
                src/index.js:--
                    >> class Comp2 extends React.Component {
                    >>      render () {
                    >>          return <h1>This is Comp2</h1>
                    >>                }
                # inside 'index.js' file , write root.render(<Comp/>);

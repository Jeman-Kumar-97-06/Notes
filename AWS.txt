How Browser/Client and Server Comms work :--
	* A Browser / Client has an IP Address.
	* A Server that has required data/ app/ website has an IP Address too
	* The Network in between managed by ISP creates / manages communication between these two.

What is SERVER Composed of :--
	* CPU 
	* RAM
	* Storage
	* DB
	* Network Devices :-- Routers, Switch , DNS Server

Traditional Way of Hosting :--
	* People used to literally buy servers from store and put them in their homes and host a website.
	* As businesses grew people had to move to a big ass office, maintain a data center room to keep the servers and then used to scale them by adding more servers and drives.
	* Problems with this approach :--
		* Lot of rent to maintain data centers.
		* Increase in cost of power supply,cooling and maintainance.
		* Adding and replacing hardware takes time.
		* Scaling is limited. [Like how many disks are you going to put in there mate!]
		* Cost of hiring a team to maintain all this shit.
Modern Cloud Computing :--
	* Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of compute power, database storage, apps, and other IT resources.
	* This has Pay-as-you-go pricing.
	* You can access all this instantly.
	* AWS owns and maintains the network-connected hardware required for these app services, while you provision and use what you need via a web app.
	* Easy to maintain and cost effective.
	* Ex :-- GMAIL is a cloud email service
		 Drop Box is a cloud storage service built on aws!
		 Netflix is a cloud video streaming service built on aws too!
	* Different types of cloud / deployment models of cloud:--
		* Private Cloud:
			* Cloud services used by a single organization, not exposed to the public.
			* So, only a single person/ members of a single organization can use it.
			* That person/organization has the complete control.
			* Enhanced security for sensitive apps / data of the organization
			* Ex: rack space company ...
		* Public Cloud :
			* A big set of computers and storage managed by companies like AWS,Azure,Google. Many people and businesses use it at the same time.
			You rent space or services when you need them, and cloud provider takes care of maintaining every thing.
			* It's flexible, easy to access, and you only pay for what you use. But it's not exclusively yours. 
			* Ex : AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure.
		* Hybrid Cloud :
			* A Hybrid Cloud is a mix of both private cloud (your own secure space) and public cloud (shared resources). 
			You can use your private setup for sensitive stuff and the public one when you need extra power or flexibility. 
			They work together, so you get the best of both worlds!
	* Five Characteristics of Cloud COmputing :--
		* On Demand Self Service :--
			* Users can provision resource and use them without human interaction from the service provider.
		* Broad Network Access :--
			* Resources available over the network and can be accessed by diverse client platforms.
		* Multi-tenancy :--
			* Multiple customers can share the same infrastructure and applications with security and privacy.
		* Rapid Elasticity and Scalability :--
			* Automatically and quickly acquire and dispose resources when needed.
			* Quickly and easily scale based on demand.
		* Measured Service:
			*

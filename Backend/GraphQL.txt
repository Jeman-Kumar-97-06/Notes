GraphQL :--
	* GraphQL is a query language.
	* An alternative to using REST APIs the traditional way.
	* Traditional way:--
		* Ex:-- 1 pokemon.com/api/pokemon ----> GET list of pokemons / Send POST/Patch/Delete req to screw with the pokemon data
		        2 pokemon.com/api/pokemon/123 --> GET pokemon with id:123 for send POST/Patch/Delete pokemon data with id:123
		* Dis-Advantages :--
			* Over-fetching :--
				* Getting more data than we need.
    				* In the example above the code line "1" will get all pokemon data.
    				* Each pokemon obj can have an id, name, power....
    				* We many not need power or we many not need id, and yet due to the restrictions in the Tranditional Way of querying data using REST APIs we have to settle 
    				with that over-fetched data.
    				
    			* Under-fetching :--
    				* Getting less data than we need.
    				* Lets say we make request to code line "2" in the above example.
    				* Web get the pokemon data that matching with id : 123. This Data Obj may have id, name, powers.
    				* This "powers" key may have a value as 'invisibility'.
    				* This value 'invisibility' many point to completely differnt data-set that has the description and limitations of the power 'invisibility'.
    				* To get this, we may need to make another request to 'pokemon.com/api/powers/456'.
    				
    	* The GraphQL way :--
    		* How it works :--
    			* Usually when making api calls in graphQL, we typically send it to a single endpoint like 'pokemon.com/api/pokemon'.
    			* It typically won't have other endpoints like shown in the 'Traditional Way' example.
    			* To query the data we send some special Graph QL syntax code.
    	* Apollo Server :--
    		* It's a popular open-source framework used to build GraphQL APIs. It simplifies the process of defining a GraphQL schema and implementing resolvers to handle queries and 
    		mutations. Built on top of NodeJS, it integrates seamlessly with JS and TS projects and can work with various backends and data sources.

What is a real-time web app:
    * Real-Time Web apps are apps that enable interacitve usage
    by users, systems,or applications.
    * They Operate within a time frame of under a sec/ milli-sec.
    * They enable users to get info/updates as soon a they ask.
    * Users do not have to check info/updates themselves with 
    seperate software / refreshing the app to get data.
    *Ex:Gaming apps, Messaging apps, Status Updates apps, Alerts app
    * Real-Time Communication between server-client can be done by
        WebSockets,Server-Sent-Events, Long-Polling,Short-Polling,
        WebRTC, WebTransport
Short Polling :--
    * An In-Efficient way to get real-time data.
    * It involves the client sending HTTP reqs at regular intervals
    to check for updates.
    * The server will recieve regular HTTP reqs and send the data
    requested or it will send an empty response.

Long Polling :--
    * A better way to get real-time data compared to Short polling.
    * It involves a http call to the server from client. The server
    will not send a response until the data requested by the http
    call is available.
    * So, the client can request the server for information that's
    not yet available.

Web socket : 
    * It's a protocol developed for bi-directional client-server 
    communication.
    * We usually send HTTP Requests to server and get data to 
    client using REST Api
    * HTTP Protocol Creates a One-Way connection between server-
    client.
    * You can either send a request to server or receive response.
    * Also, these HTTP Requests are StateLess. ie., each request is 
    executed indepently, without any knowledge of the requests that
    were executed before it. The connection will be closed and re-
    opened for each request.
    * When it comes to Web Socket, after handshake between server-
    client, the connection will be open until one of them drops the
    connection.
    * The Server & Client can send responses & requests 
    simultaneously.
Socket.io :-
    * Socket.io is an npm package used to implement WebSocket.
    * Socket.io is not a WebSocket Only Implementation.
    * Socket.io uses heartbeat mechanism to check if a WebSocket
    connection can be established. Then it used web socket to 
    connect or else it will use http for Web Transport
    * Socket.io has features like packet buffering and Automatic
     Reconnection.
    * Install socket.io with "npm install socket.io"

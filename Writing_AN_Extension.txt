Extension Terminology:--
	* Manifest :--
		The extension manifest is the only required file that must
		have a specific file name: manifest.json. It also has to be
		located in the extension's root dir. The manifest records
		important metadata, defines resources, declares permissions
		 and identifies which files to run in the background and on
		the page.
	* Service Workers :--
		A service worker runs in the background and handles browser
		events, like removing bookmarks, closing a tab or other 
		tasks like loading api resonse data and so on. They don't 
		have access to the DOM, but you can combine it with an off-
		screen document for this use case.
	* Content Script :--
		These run JS in the context of web page that users visit,
		without screwing with the javascript of that web page.
	* Toolbar actinon :--

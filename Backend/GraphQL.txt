GraphQL :--
	* GraphQL is a query language.
	* An alternative to using REST APIs the traditional way.
	* Traditional way:--
		* Ex:-- 1 pokemon.com/api/pokemon ----> GET list of pokemons / Send POST/Patch/Delete req to screw with the pokemon data
		        2 pokemon.com/api/pokemon/123 --> GET pokemon with id:123 for send POST/Patch/Delete pokemon data with id:123
		* Dis-Advantages :--
			* Over-fetching :--
				* Getting more data than we need.
    				* In the example above the code line "1" will get all pokemon data.
    				* Each pokemon obj can have an id, name, power....
    				* We many not need power or we many not need id, and yet due to the restrictions in the Tranditional Way of querying data using REST APIs we have to settle 
    				with that over-fetched data.
    				
    			* Under-fetching :--
    				* Getting less data than we need.
    				* Lets say we make request to code line "2" in the above example.
    				* Web get the pokemon data that matching with id : 123. This Data Obj may have id, name, powers.
    				* This "powers" key may have a value as 'invisibility'.
    				* This value 'invisibility' many point to completely differnt data-set that has the description and limitations of the power 'invisibility'.
    				* To get this, we may need to make another request to 'pokemon.com/api/powers/456'.

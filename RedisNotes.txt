What is Redis :--
    * Redis is a in-memory data store.
    * Uses Key-Value Structures.
    * All data is stored in RAM.
    * When is say RAM, it's the server side RAM.
    * So when the server crashes, the data in Redis will be lost.
    * But now after some updates and features upgrades, Redis can be used as a Database.
    * It can store data even if the server crashes.
    * Now it has features like ,Data Persistance, Data Replication,JSON Support[It accepts
      JSON data], Search [querying data], Redis OM : Object Mapper, Redis Cloud.

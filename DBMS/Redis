What is Redis :--
    -> Redis is a in-memory data store
    -> It's a key-value structure.
    -> Traditionally used as a caching layer.
    -> Data is stored in ram [so, very fast]
    -> Usually if an api has to connect to a database to get data,
       it would take time. But using Redis as a caching layer can save time.
    -> It stores queried data temporarily to save time when queries are repetitive
       or similar to each other.
    -> Redis' cache is stored on server -side
    -> The disadvantage of Redis as a caching layer is, when the server restarts or crashes,
       the data will be deleted.
    -> But due to improvements, Redis can now be used as a primary database.
    -> This is due to features like Data Persistance, JSON Support, Search, Redis OM [Object Mapper] 
    -> The Above features attached as modules to Redis Core, together form Redis Stack.
    -> Data Types in Redis :--
            * Key - Value pairs with key as identifier. Ex : name --> 'jeman'
                                                             age  --> 27
            * The Values can be 'string' [ex: 'Jeman']
                                'sets'   [ex: {'jeman','jeevan','kumar'}] --> unordered, unique elements
                                'hashes' -> Data structures that allow you to store multiple field-value
                                           pairs under a single key. Each field-value pair within a hash
                                           is referred to as a "field" and "value". They look like objects
                                'lists'  -> collection of elements which don't need to be unique.
                                'sorted sets' -> a collection of unique strings [members] ordered by an 
                                                associated score.
    -> Key-Value Pairs :--
    	* When it comes to storing key-value pairs with unique key,
    		Ex :-- books --> {'book1','book2'}
    	* Storing different books as hashes:
    		Ex :-- books:1 --> {title:"...",author:"..."} 
    		       books:2 --> {title:"...",author:"..."}
    		       * In the above example, 1 and 2 are IDs.

Using Redis Cloud and Redis Insight:--
	* Signup for a free account on Redis website.
	* You will be redirected to 'Redis Cloud Console'/Dashboard.
	* Create a database and from the 'Databases' tab download 'Redis Insight'
	* 'Redis Insight' is like 'Mongoose Compass'.
	* Open 'Redis Insight'. The UI is intuitive.
	* The 'Workbench' tab in 'Redis Insight' allows us to execute commands to screw with data.
Redis Basic Commands :--
	* Strings & Numbers :--
		>> SET name "jeman" --> will save as string
		>> SET name jeman   --> will save as string as well
		>> SET name jeman kumar --> Error :-- if space is included, use quotes.
		>> SET name 'jeman kumar' --> THis works.
		
		>> GET name --> Will get the value of the key 'name'
		
		>> DEL name --> Will delete the data with key as 'name'.
		
		>> MSET name1 jeman name2 'jeman n' rating 10 --> MSET [multiple set]
		>> MGET name1 name1 rating --> [Multiple GET]
		
		>> GETRANGE name 0 3 --> if 'jeman', output will be 'jema' --> 0,1,2,3 characters in the string 'jeman'
		>> GETRANGE name -3 -1 --> if 'jeman', output will be 'man' --> -3 -2 -1 characters in the string 'jeman'
		
		>> SETRANGE name 2 abc --> if 'jeman', output will be 'jeabc' --> from char 2 it will insert 'abc' by removing everything.
		
		>> INCR rating --> rating which is now '10' will be increased to '11'
		>> DECR rating --> it wil go back to 10
		>> INCRBY rating 5 --> it will increase to 15
		>> DECRBY rating 5 --> it will be back to 10

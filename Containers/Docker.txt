Virtualization vs Containerization:--
    * Traditional way to run a bussiness with servers:--
        * Apps run on servers.
        * A company's email service / DB service / Website used to run on one server each.
        * The OS on those servers didn't have the capability to run multiple apps securely on a single server.
        * Running one application per server was a waste of money.
        * To solve this virtual machines were invented.
    * Virtual Machines :--
        * When it comes to VMs, if you want to run a email, web service, and app on a single server, you install 3
        VMs inside a server.
        * These 3 VMs share the hardware resources of the server
        * VM :-- 
                    server/hardware ---> Hypervisor ---> Virtual machines--> OS--> Apps
                * At bottom server/hardware.
                * Hypervisor is what allows one machine to run multiple virtual machines.
                * Hypervisor allocates and controls the sharing the machines' hardware.
                        Ex :-- VMware ESXi
                           Citrix XenServer
                           Microsoft Hyperv
                * VM uses the shares hardware resources to run the os and app upon it.
                * Each VM has their own OS.
                * Dis-Advantages :-- 
                    * Consume a lot of disk space.
                    * Consumes a lot of RAM and CPU power from server.
                    * Slow to startup.
                    * Requires a license for each OS.

    * Containers:--
         * A container is an app that's been packages with all the:
                Files , Configurations, Dependencies necessary to run it.
         *
